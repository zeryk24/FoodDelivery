# FoodDelivery

C# backend for school project (System Development in C#/.NET (MUNI FI - PV179)) <strong>created by Erik Báča with assistance and help from Marek Macho</strong>.

The "Food Delivery" project is a backend implementation of a food delivery system. Our system allows customers to browse through a list of restaurants, view menus, and place orders for their favorite meals. Customers can pay using their preferred payment method, view their order history, and leave reviews. The system also includes an admin panel for managing restaurants, dishes, users, and other relevant information.
