# FoodDelivery

C# backend for school project (System Development in C#/.NET (MUNI FI - PV179)) created by Erik Báča with assistance and help from Marek Macho.

The "Food Delivery" project is a backend implementation of a food delivery system. Our system allows customers to browse through a list of restaurants, view menus, and place orders for their favorite meals. Customers can pay using their preferred payment method, view their order history, and leave reviews. The system also includes an admin panel for managing restaurants, dishes, users, and other relevant information.

Requirements

User Authentication
Create a login and registration system for users. Users should be able to sign up.

User Personal Data Management
Users should be able to update their personal information such as delivery address, payment details, and other relevant information.

Order Placement
Create an order placement system for users, where they can select the restaurant, choose dishes/drinks from the menu, and select the payment method (card, cash, voucher).

Order History
Users should be able to view their order history. The order history should include details such as the restaurant name, order date, order status, and total amount.

Reviews System
Create a review system for users where they can provide feedback on restaurants and meals. Users should be able to rate the restaurant and the food quality, as well as leave comments.

Admin Management
Create an admin panel where the admin can add, remove, and edit restaurants, dishes, users, and other relevant information. The admin should also be able to view order history and user reviews.

Menu Management
Create a menu page for restaurants where users can view the menu and select dishes/drinks. The menu page should allow users to filter the menu based on several parameters such as price, type of food (pizza, hamburger, etc.).

Search Functionality
Create a search functionality where users can search for restaurants based on several parameters such as location, price range, type of food, and others.
